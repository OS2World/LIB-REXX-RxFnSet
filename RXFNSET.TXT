  RXFNSET PACKAGE                                                              
  Version 1.4
  RXFNSET for OS/2 Version 1.x or 2.x                                          
                                                                                

  I committed this package in my own time and support it in my own time,
  please be gentle :-)

  I was thinking about writing some of included functions for a long
  time, but for myself I always found that I can work it around.
  But once there was no other way.  After the first one, the next were
  easy ... with a little help from my friends :-)  

  SOURCE CODE 
         If you want to obtain source code by:
         REQUEST RXFNSRC FROM CONT06 AT LEXVM2

  PLEASE
         send me all comments you have, especialy negative, 
         directly to me, or append them to REXXOS2 forum (accepted
         by Rick McGuire - forum owner)  


  This package consist of following FUNCTIONS:
     RxSetFH           - to set new number of FH for process OS/2 1.x & 2.x.
     RxAddFH           - to add number of FH to the set already available 
                            2.x ONLY.
     RxKillProcess     - for killing OS/2 process by PID
     RxWildCard        - for editing name with wild card
     RxQueryFileSystem - for information on file system for drive
     RxTaskList        - for information on active tasks and theirs PIDs

  You will find some useful examples included.  You can, for example, set number of FH
  available from OS/2 prompt before calling your program and it will remain
  available till OS/2 session is closed.  There is no way, known to me, to
  decrease number of once assigned FH.  If you know one, please let me know 
  I'll add new function to this package.  If you need another CP function
  to be called from REXX let me know.

  NOTES:
     All functions are kept in dual form (16 and 32 bit).  But if you haven't
     fully move to OS/2 2.x (support, develope for 1.x) you can use only 16 
     bit vwersion which will work on 2.x system too.  There is one exception.
     RxAddFH function works only for 2.x because it uses Kernel calls with
     no equvalents in erlier version of OS/2.


* KNOWN PROBLEMS:

!!! RxQueryFileSystem 1.x ONLY BECAUSE OF 2.0 BUG  
    2.0 version always returns empty string        
    Wait for next release of Toolkit (?) System (?)

  DISCLAIMER:
       All support and plans for future are subject to:  

       1) public response to this package, 
       2) my time, since this is my own time and pleasure, 
       3) my availability, because I am only a contractor (end of May 92 ?)


  PLANS FOR THE FUTURE:
  - Add more different functions (how about most or all of CP Calls ?!)
    and change name of this package, or make somebody to glue it to one 
    already existing.

                 running in another session.  Main process remains to be CMD.EXE
                 There is a workaround.  You need a .EXE to call REXX interpretter.
                 You can use for that purpose Pat Mueller's RUNMACRO package,
                 generate RUNMACRO.EXE, rename it to any name and call your  
                 REXX program by RUNMACRO (>RUNMACRO MYREXX).  Request RUNMACRO
                 from Pat, or drop me a note, I'll send you ready .EXE.

 --  RxWildCard - is a REXX external function (written in C) which 
               will edit name with wildcard to help you copy/move ....
               or simply audit user entry.  It uses DosEditName CP
               call, so it accept full wildcard specification with
               multi level <.> (dots), <*> and <?>.  
        
               PARAMETERS ACCEPTED:

             OTHER INFO:                                                                   
               - it can be used to chect if specified name matches wildcard
                 (or opposite) by comparing Result with Source.  If they are
                 the same after editing - match is true.  Purpose for writing
                 this function first time was to check REXX variables against
                 wild card specyfication.  

             RETURNS:
               - Source Edited with WildCard
